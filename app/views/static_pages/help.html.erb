<p>
	The HIE Sample Tracker enables researchers and facility staff at the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment to manage, 
	document, and search for environmental samples collected at various sampling field sites. In particular, it:
	<ol>
		<li>
			allows research scientists to set up a batch of samples to be sampled at a particular facility
		</li>
		<li>
			allows facility staff to monitor what samples are being collected at a particular facility, on what dates, and 
			under which scientific project
		</li>
		<li>
			automatically creates sample information templates as well as sample barcodes for easy sample identification
		</li>
		<li>
			enables researchers to enter details of single samples using web forms, or multiple samples through batch 
			spreadsheet upload
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<h4 class="topspace50"><a name="overview">Overview</a></h4>

<p> At HIE, it is common for environmental samples to be collected as part of a batch effort as opposed to single samples 
	being sampled here and there. Therefore, a primary element of the Sample Tracker is the 'Sample Set', a grouping of 
	samples that may be collected as part of one sampling day. Typically, this will be a set of samples collected on one day 
	at one specific facility and as part of a particular project.
</p>
<p>
	The diagram below outlines the typical steps involved in using the Sample Tracker to request collection of a set of 
	samples, documentation of those samples, as well as searching the database of completed samples for samples of 
	interest. A more detailed walkthrough of the steps involved are discussed in the following sections.

<h4 class="topspace20">Registering a New Account</h4>
<p>
  In order to use the create and edit features of the Sample Tracker you will need to register an account and log 
  in (login is not required to view details of samples  etc). You can register a new account by following the link 
  on the home page. If you have already registered you can sign in** using the link on the home page or using the 
  menu on the top right corner. 
</p>
<p>
	** Note that upon registration the account needs to be authorised by a member of the admin team (they will be automatically 
	notified). This may take a little time. 
</p>

<h4 class="topspace20">Sample Sets</h4>

<p>
A 'Sample Set' refers to a batch of samples that are being collected on a particular sampling day/period, under a single project 
at one facility. For example, a sample set may refer to 50 samples that are collected for project P003 at the EucFACE facility. 
In advance of any targeted sample collection, a researcher should initiate a new sample set in the Sample Tracker and provide upfront 
details of that set (facility, project, etc).      
</p> 
<h5 class="topspace20">Creating a new Sample Set</h5>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Using the menu bar at the top of the page, click on 'Sample Sets', then 'Create New' on the resulting dropdown menu.
			<%= image_tag("help_pages/ss_create.jpeg", :alt => "sample set create new", :class=>"center_border_img") %>
		</li>
		<li>
			This will open the 'New Sample Set' page. The following fields are to be completed:
			  <ul>
			  	<li>
			  		Facility - Choose the Facility at which you will be sampling from the dropdown menu (Tip: You can begin typing the name of the facility to narrow down the list of available options). A full list of 
			  		available Facilities as well as their details can be found by clicking on the 'View Resources' menu on the top right menu bar and then selecting 'Facilities'. If the Facility that you require is not 
			  		in the list use the 'Contact' link (on the bottom of the page) to get in touch. 
			  		<%= image_tag("help_pages/resources_dropdown.jpeg", :alt => "sample set new page", :class=>"center_border_img") %>
			  	</li>
			  	<li>
			  		Project - State which Project the samples will be collected for. Again, a full list of projects available can be found under the Resources menu.
			  	</li>
			  	<li>
			  		Sampling Date - Choose which date you would like to carry out the actual sampling on. 
			  	</li>
			  	<li>
			  		Sampling Date - Choose which date you would like to carry out the actual sampling on.
