# SampleTracker 

Application for tracking environmental samples
------------

The SampleTracker application is used at the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment to allow research scientists and 
facility personnel to track environmental research samples. In particular it

 1. allows researchers to request collection of a batch (or sample set) of samples for a particular scientific project
 2. facility managers to monitor and keep track of environmental samples collected at their research facility
 3. stores a rich body of metadata associated with each sample in a centralised database
 4. provides a web-based interface for sample management, allowing 
    * sample information upload
    * querying of the database for retrieval of samples already collected thus reducing the need for unnecessary resampling 
 5. Automated QR code/barcode generation for quick sample identification
